# BASP-M2023
## Week 02
This week problematic was making an html about the landing page we made last week on figma for the "MegaRocket Gym". We learned to use: Visual Code Studio, Git and Github for making commits and synchronized them with the online repository. 
# Landing Page
The landing page has access to the differents sections so you can move and go through the differents options this gym offers you.
## Page Content
The page contents sections such as "Menu" where you can Log In, Sing In or ask for more information about the gym.
Also, you can see all the adresses where you can reach the gym staff and comunicate with to ask them any question you have.
Last but not least, you can see the differents activities they provide and the memberships options they offer, and also, know about their history.
